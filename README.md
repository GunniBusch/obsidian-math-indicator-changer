It can make the math equations generated by AI display correctly in Obsidian.

## Installation

Open the file that needs to be modified, and press `Ctrl+P` to open the command panel.

Type `Math Indicator Changer` and press `Enter` to execute the command. Then all the patterns of `\( \)` and `\[ \]` will be changed to `$ $` and `$$ $$`.

If you only want to change part of the file, you can select the section that want to change first, then use the command.

A more convenient way is that you can set a Hotkey for this command, you can search for `Change math indicator` in the Hotkeys page.

### Way 2
Click the Dollar icon on the toolbar, it will change the file currently you are focusing on.

## Warnings
